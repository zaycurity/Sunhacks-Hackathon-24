About the Project
We developed this Python-based facial tracking and object recognition software during the 2024 SunHacks Hackathon hosted by Arizona State University. The project leverages advanced technologies such as OpenCV and DeepFace to implement real-time facial recognition and object tracking.

Key Features
Real-time Face Detection: Tracks and identifies individuals in a live video stream using facial recognition algorithms.
Object Recognition: Detects and classifies objects in the same video frame.
Multi-threading for Performance: Optimized using multi-threading to ensure smooth video processing and quick face matching.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, DeepFace, Dlib, NumPy
Tools: Git, Visual Studio Code

Challenges
During the hackathon, we encountered several challenges, including:
Efficient frame processing
Accurate face matching
Ensuring real-time performance
Through teamwork and creative problem-solving, we successfully overcame these obstacles.
